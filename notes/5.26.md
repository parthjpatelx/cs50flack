after user sends a message to the channel, the get_message funtion should be executed. Currently, when we create a channel, we get the message that there are no messages with in it. However, when we send additional messages we can't find this.

modify javascript so that special characters cant be part of channel names 

Side note:if join room is sucessful, we should have an event listener that calls get_message

Bug: When we create a new channel, 'no message in channel' succesfully appears. However, when we subsequently try to type in a message, this message does not show up in innerHTML of message tag. However, this message seems to be broadcasted by other people who are in the channel.

this suggests that the user who just created the channel did not succesfully join it in socket.io

try to confirm that the room has been succesfully joined in socket.io 
What does leave_room and join_room return?
set up 'join' websocket to return success if room was joined. Return success = True if this works.
set up javascript listener to listen to server's response. 
if server responds success = true, 
add an alert whch says you have succesfully joined the channel.

OR

add socket.join(room) after user joins a creates a channel
add a callback function, alert('user has succeesfully joined room);

bug: when user double clicks link name it becames unbolded.
